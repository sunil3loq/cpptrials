1. boxplot
1a. All the values in boxplot - min, first quartile, median, third quartile, max
1b. IQR - third quartile - first quartile

2. Modifiec box plot
2a. Instead of having max and min as the ends, it has first quartile-1.5*IQR and third quartile+1.5*IQR
2b. Outliers are visible as dots

3. Mean
3a. Trimmed mean- x% trimmed mean is mean on data that has the tope and bottem x% removed

4. Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation

5. Histogram
5a. Look for Modes
5b. tails (left, right, long, short)
5c. symmetric or not
5d. outliers

6. % of missing values

7. Comparison of unimodal symmetric distribution to the normal distribution
7a. mean - sd to mean + sd - 68% in normal
mean - 2*sd to mean + 2*sd - 95% in normal
mean - 3*sd to mean + 3*sd - 99.7% in normal
